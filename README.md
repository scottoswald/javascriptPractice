# JavaScript Practice

This is the work I've done whilst doing the FrontEnd Masters course
'JavaScript: From First Steps to Professional'

## Retrospective:

I'm really pleased I took this course. Ate a lot of humble pie, as there were fundamentals I thought I knew, but evidently didn't!

## Next Steps:

I am now loving onto a TypeScript course.
